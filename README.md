## About

This is another complementary project for the Eye Tracking Goggles. The goal of this project is to display 3D stimuli/objects on a 2D screen for realistic 3D testing of the eyes. The above code is a version of the software that handles stimulus(currently statically).

## Technology

The software is in C# and we used the Monogame engine as our base for development. 

## Hardware

Currently, we are using high refreshrate monitors, DLP-Link shutter glasses and a custom DLP emitter to get the glasses to "sync" with the screen.
